ABOUT
=====

Modifies a RHEL 6.4+ x86_64 Workstation or Server DVD with a kickstart
that will install a system that is configured and hardened for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. (Latest Update RHEL 6.9)

The kickstart script involves the integration of the following projects 
into a single installer:

   - classification-banner.py (Python for displaying graphical classification banner)
   
        https://github.com/RedHatGov/classification-banner

   - SCAP Security Guide (SSG) Content - Benchmark and hardening scripts for the 
     system after installation
   - Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) Scan is method for using known standards
    to run vulnerability and compliance scans. This allows the user to evaluate and secure their systems.

HARDENING INFORMATION
=====================

Here is some additional information added by the supplemental hardening script
in addition to the SSG:

1. The kernel is cofigured in FIPS 140-2 mode on install

2. Shell timeout (bash/csh) is 15 minutes of inactivity, vlock will lock CLI
   console

3. The 'wheel' group is required for privleged users (beyond root) to run 
   `su -` or `sudo -i` commands, sudo timeout is 5 minutes

4. The 'sshusers' group is required for SSH/SFTP access, other users are 
   limited to console access without this group
   
5. Runlevel 5 is configured by default 

6. Additional Software such as McAfee EPo/HBSS may be required meet site 
   policy

7. Configure NTP (/etc/ntp.conf) and rsyslog logging to remote server 
   (/etc/rsyslog.conf)

8. Create users:

        Local Console Access Only (Unprivileged)
          
               # useradd -m -c "Local User" localuser
               
        Remote Access (Unprivileged)
          
               # useradd -m -c "Remote User" -G sshusers remoteuser
               
        System Administrator (SA) (Privileged User)
               
               # useradd -m -c "V6ICAD" -G sshusers,wheel V6ICAD
               
        (Optional) After adding SAs to the system, lock the root account:
          
               # passwd -l root

TACSIM NOTES
===========

1. The hardening script has been modified for TACSIM purposes with some deviation from the STIG 
  - the classification banner will not be displayed on the workstation
  - Run level 5 has been configured to enable the Desktop GUI by default
  - A TACSIM I$T Workstation system profile is included with most of the packages required for a TACSIM COTS  (Virtualization, office suite, mysql-server)
  - Future work will be required to automate some of the post-installations steps below
   
  Installing additional packages 
  =================
- Depending on the System Profile chosen during install, certain packages will not be available in your system.
- Moreover, this is a default  RHEL stock install with only the software version included in the release  
- Follow applicable instructions to update software versions and install additional packages not included with the system profile. 

1. The additional librairies and programs needed by TACSIM can be installed directly using the "dev_pack" folder
   Refer to https://dev.azure.com/TACSIM/TACSIM/_wiki/wikis/TACSIM.wiki/98/TACSIM-install_dev_pack-Instructions

2.  To add the TACSIM automated restore and backup , refer to https://dev.azure.com/TACSIM/TACSIM/_wiki/wikis/TACSIM.wiki/88/Automated-restore-and-backup-functionalities-on-a-TACSIM-system-from-a-restore-partition-using-clonezilla

3.  - McAfee HBSS(Host-Based Security System) installation procedures: https://dev.azure.com/TACSIM/TACSIM/_wiki/wikis/TACSIM.wiki/189/RHEL-6-McAfee-HBSS(Host-Based-Security-System)-installation).

4.  RHEL Registration Refer to : https://dev.azure.com/TACSIM/TACSIM/_wiki/wikis/TACSIM.wiki/45/RedHat-Registration-for-a-Tacsim-delivery
 

**TODO**: 

- [ ]   Integrate as much as possible into a single installer the above post-installation steps
- [ ]   Create TACSIM ETL and VM Workstation profiles
- [ ]   Make the Kickstart installation source available on the network (NFS, FTP, or HTTP/S) with applicable instructions on how to use it
